# domain_driven_design_note_app
This app was mainly created while Domain Driven Design course by Reso Coder (https://resocoder.com/category/tutorials/flutter/firebase-ddd/), but I'd decided to introduce some important changes.
Firstly, I've resigned from using Value Objects and Data Transfer Objects, deciding to simplify the app architecture in order to look more like "real life" apps.
Secondly, I was really unhappy with given UI, so I've created my own. You can see some screenshots here:

Some other code differences stem from fact that I've created this project two years after the original course was published and I've decided to use the latest dependencies available at the moment (the biggest differences are related to the bloc package breaking changes that occured since then).
